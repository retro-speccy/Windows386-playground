## Introduction

### What is Windows/386?

A flavour of Windows 2.1x and the first Windows to use the protected mode features of the then new 386 processor. It was the first to offer parallel execution of applications in virtual 8086-mode offering 640k memory for each application, thus being the first version offering real usability.

It was pressed into production by Compaq to make use of the 386 processors introduced in their [new line of computers](https://dfarq.homeip.net/compaq-deskpro-386/) overtaking IBM still just selling 286-based PC systems. Microsoft was even using Compaq Deskpro 386 machines for development.
